# Weather Classification with CNN, Residual Networks & Transfer Learning

**Image classification of 11 weather conditions using custom CNNs and transfer learning with ResNet101 & EfficientNetB7.**

---

## Problem Statement

Predict the weather type from an input image across 11 categories:  
`dew, fog/smog, frost, glaze, hail, lightning, rain, rainbow, rime, sandstorm, snow`

Dataset: 6862 labeled images (balanced)

## Models Implemented

### 1 - Simple CNN  
Sequential model built from scratch using basic Conv2D and MaxPooling layers  
`Homework3_1.ipynb`

### 2 - CNN with Residual Blocks + Data Augmentation  
Custom architecture with manually coded residual blocks (like in ResNet)  
+ extensive image augmentation (`ImageDataGenerator`)  
`Homework3_2.ipynb`

### 3 - Transfer Learning  
Fine-tuned models pretrained on ImageNet:
- **ResNet101**
- **EfficientNetB7**  
`Homework3_EfficientNetB7.ipynb` and `Homework3_ResNet101.ipynb`

## Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy (train / val)
- Loss curves
- Model comparison
- (Optional) Confusion matrix, per-class breakdown
